                    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm a passionate and dedicated software designer with a strong background in developing, testing, and deploying innovative software solutions.
                        With four+ years of experience, I have honed my skills in app and web development, built a solid understanding of machine learning techniques and methods and thrive in creating correct, clean and optimised code.
                        I often use React.js or Vue.js frontend development, Django, Flask, or FastAPI for backend development and NoSQL database management systems like Firebase or MongoDB.
                        However, I am no stranger to SQL "RDBMS" like SQLite and PostgreSQL.

                    <h2>What I Do?</h2>
                    <p>
                        I specialize in systems design, web design, app design and the application of machine learning models. My technical proficiency is complemented by strong analytical and problem-solving abilities,
                        allowing me to deliver robust and efficient software solutions.

                    <h2>Why Hire Me?</h2>
                    <p>
                        I bring a unique blend of creativity and technical expertise to every project I undertake. As a team player with strong communication skills,
                        I thrive in collaborative environments and excel in translating client requirements into scalable and user-friendly software solutions.
